		<p>The Centralized Patient Record Management provides an easy way
			for patients records to be accessed during patient visits. It also
			provides a convenient way for records to be shared between hospitals
			registered with the application. This will help reduce the amount of
			paperwork patients are required to fill out. This will also help
			provide doctors a more complete picture of a patientâ€™s medical
			history, so they can provide higher quality health care.</p>
		<p>The Centralized Patient Record Management application was
			developed at the University of Texas at Dallas as part of the
			Software Engineering CS 3354 course.</p>
